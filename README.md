## 🧠 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- ✅ **Filtering**: Using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, and `IS NULL` to extract relevant rows.
- ✅ **Sorting & Ranges**: Ordering results and filtering based on numeric or date ranges.
- ✅ **Aggregation**: Using functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`.
- ✅ **Grouping**: Applying `GROUP BY` for category-level insights.
- ✅ **Joins**: Combining data across multiple tables with `INNER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT JOINs`.
- ✅ **Conditional Logic**: Using `CASE`, `IF` for dynamic column calculations.
- ✅ **Subqueries**: Nested logic for comparisons and advanced filters.
- ✅ **Calculated Fields**: Profit percentages, revenue conversions, and unit normalization.
